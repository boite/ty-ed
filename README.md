# ty-ed: Thank you Edward Snowden

Understanding the information leaked by Ed and made public by intrepid
journalists. A work in progress.


## Goals

- Catalogue the primary sources and accompanying explanatory
  reporting.
- Catalogue the information contained in the primary sources.
- ...


## Phase One: Discovery of Primary Sources

Build upon the work of other people to create a directory of primary
sources and accompanying reporting:-

- Electronic Freedom Foundation: A table linking to primary sources
  and reporting [[EFF]]
- Courage Foundation: A collection of weblog pages linking to primary
  sources and reporting [[CF]]
- Reddit r/NSALeaks: A wiki document linking to primary sources and
  reporting [[r/NSALeaks]]
- Tranparency Toolkit: Data extracted from primary sources [[TT/NSA]]
- Al Jazeera Timeline of Edward Snowden Revelations: covering 2013
  [[AJ/ESTimeline]]

The original idea was to combine the information from these sources
into one master directory, but this proved difficult for a number of
reasons.  It was decided to use these sources to seed a manual review
of the reporting and to build the directory using a mixture of code
and human intelligence.  The methodology is outlined in
[METHODOLGY](doc/METHODOLOGY).
